===================================


On windows : go to jfrog artifactory downloads : there are two options one is pro and another is oss.

check if jdk and mvn is installed.

then create the set up on jfrog localhost. get the settings.xml and modify it accordingly.

now save this settings.xml file to .m2 directory.

now try to compile the project any maven project, you can see it is using jfrog artifactory for downloading dependencies.

Now if you want to deploy any project as an artifactory then you have got a code snippet during set up on jfrog.

Something like this : 
<distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
        <id>snapshots</id>
        <name>DESKTOP-7NJ66FC-snapshots</name>
        <url>http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-snapshot-local</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>

and a encryped password like this : cmVmdGtuOjAxOjE3MTc2Njg2MDM6RXhnMnZIbG95cDZTRTU3bExJUGN4RmpBQUpF


add the code snippet above in the pom.xml(after </dependencies> tag) of project that you want to deploy on jfrog.


go to root of deployable maven project and exec : mvn deploy.

Now you can use the deployed project as dependency in any project.
