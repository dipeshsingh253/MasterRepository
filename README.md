# MasterRepository

Master Repository is a collection of projects or codes written by me throughout my learning journey. This is more like a snapshot to look back at if I need it in the future.

> I'm consolidating my learnings in a central location for future reference. While my initial organization wasn't ideal (admittedly, I'm still working on that!), it became difficult to keep track of everything. To improve accessibility, I've migrated my learning logs to the 'Punk Records' repository. The original repository remains a valuable resource, but this new approach will ensure better organization moving forward.
